### Unformatted Text: okay well the first question is beliefs um adequately reconstruct uh the past much less one's own i mean the difficulties of constructing and reconstructing that already i would respond by putting in parentheses right there under quote in quote marks the very notion of biographical enterprise but as i recall as i remember my life uh it has it how did i get into history is the question right how did i get in and beyond that how do i get into meta history how did i slip into meta history and uh the the answer to that question is um a typical socialist realist uh kind of uh or thirties kind of uh scenario born to working class family in the southern united states who went to detroit the manufacturing center during the depression to find work and raised exposed in school to make aware of class differences in a way that i wouldn't have been had i not been someone coming from a relatively integrated uh southern cultural background i was the southerner in this northern environment so that plus uh then the urban environment place of great racial tension detroit race riots of the early 1940s occurred very near the navy and going to public schools going to the city university wayne state university to college where i discovered history i mean and it was an object of fascination for me so why would anyone be interested in the past since the notion of tradition is a mystery for me as well and so i became as interested in why people study the past and what ideological uses is made in the study of the past as much interest in that as i was in finding out what the past was all about is that i was governed in those days by socialist ideology socialist convictions and part of the kind of ideology critique uh enterprise uh in a kind of social science mode that's the way i would history but i studied the subject i studied was medieval history which would be a strange thing but uh i recall that it was led into that by the figure of max weber uh as a kind of model and vapor have been began as an ancient historian medieval studies and then moved on to modern and contemporary history so there's a kind of trajectory in my own career which is not uncommon among historians but i think it's important to note that the way i got into history was through socialist ideology and uh a certain kind of left wing political commitment and i think those are important factors to consider when we talk about why people study history ### Instruction: Convert the following unformatted text into well-structured sentences. 
### Unformatted Text: that sort of in the middle ages how could anyone live in that kind of cultural dispensary how could it sustain itself for a thousand years that was the question and i found out that most of the people who were studying the middle ages believed in them so i recognized that i couldn't work comfortably in that as a professional student so i increasingly turned to the study of the ideology of history history itself not as an antidote to ideology and a demystification of ideology but the way his historical knowledge and information are used in the construction of ideologies so that that contrast between ideology and history serving as history serving as this ideology serving as a distorted version of what was offered in this pure form in historical reconstruction that collapsed that distinction crossed and that's what led me into this whole question of thinking about the rewriting writing and rewriting the past and the philosophy of history that's do you want to talk about uh i mean one interesting thing 12th century church history i was studying administrative history it was the papal administration and what i was studying was the overthrow of the gregorian party in the um 12th century papacy by the forces the cistercian reform forces it was a it was papal politics but curial politics the politics of the curia which had just been it's just been formed really by the gregorian party the cognac's order the clinic order was the dominant force in curio politics but in 1133 they had a an overthrow a deposition of one of the popes anatomists ii and behind this uh revolution the deposing of the pope and the installation of innocent perception as the reveal it was a disputed papal election led to a relationship was that where the cistercians uh and saint bernard of clerval and a whole group of anti-clinic they were they were they represented different cultural politics among other things it had to do with church architecture decoration uh attitudes towards printed taxes against oral traditions so and all these things came together in this conflict between the clinics and the cistercians and i was studying that as a historian but what i found interesting is how this conflict played out in the administrative history of the papacy and it was a fascinating study because it was a study of power politics and how power was organized within the church itself so it was a study of political culture and cultural politics within the church and how they interacted with each other and that's what i found interesting about studying 12th century church history ### Instruction: Convert the following unformatted text into well-structured sentences. 
### Unformatted Text: converged here in a political form so that's what i was studying but the first stuff i published was on philosophy of history because on people like rj collinwood and uh christopher dawson and and uh people that sort of stuff i was always interested in the relationship between history historical research and philosophy of history and what i began to see is that the similarities i mean among historians the orthodox view is that history is one thing philosophy of history is a distortion the mode of a believed to be a highly conceptualized and abstract rendition of the historical record for uh ideological purposes i uh i increasingly came to the view that these qualities were different in form their formal attributes were different that there was no real distinction at the semantic level between the two genres of historical reflection so that this commonplace which for me every history presupposes a philosophy of history and every philosophy of history presupposes a certain body of historical information that justifies its implantment of the data in the way in which you do it at a very high level of abstractions as hagel does or marx and angles do in the communist manifesto and it appears that you're doing it in a concrete in greater much greater detail in a microscopic study of a discrete historical period literally detailed richly elaborate but in reality the formal attributes of the semantics of the two representations so that i wanted to collapse that distinction not fully any more than i wanted to want to collapse the distinction between narrative and description but these become emphases within discourses ways of different kinds of emphasis rather than a polar opposition uh or activities when you're reading history there's always a kind of a reality that's generated by the text he's seen i mean in your book you more or less work you're more or less trying to figure out how that reality is produced yeah i'm sure that takes you into a study what's the function of the detail that that's there and provides a kind of a texture for the reader to imagine themselves within the historical world but then also in terms of the philosophical implications of your work what's the relationship between history and philosophy and how do they inform each other i mean you mentioned earlier philosopher like rj collinwood and christopher dawson and uh people who have been interested in this relationship so that's a really interesting question because i think there are two different ways of thinking about the relationship between history and philosophy one is to see them as essentially distinct disciplines with their own methods and approaches but also with their own distinctive subject matter and then on the other hand you can see them as being deeply intertwined in terms of their epistemological foundations and their methodologies so that i think what's interesting about collinwood and dawson is that they were both interested in this question of how history and philosophy are related to each other and how they inform each other but they approached it from different perspectives i mean collinwood was a philosopher who became interested in history and he wrote a lot about the role of metaphysics and teleology in historical explanation while dawson was an historian who became interested in philosophy and he wrote a lot about the nature of historical knowledge and its relationship to philosophical concepts like truth and objectivity so i think what's interesting is that these two perspectives can be brought together in a way that allows us to see history as a kind of philosophical enterprise but also to see philosophy as a kind of historical enterprise ### Instruction: Convert the following unformatted text into well-structured sentences. 
### Unformatted Text: information but it doesn't have any other function apparently in the text and the aberrant detail in the fictional text gives the reality of that now what's the that is to say it it nails down the events in reality the small door behind charlotte corday why is it why is why does michelle give us the information that it's a small door why not just say a door um he says small ads of detail that doesn't have any other function than to say this is concrete and now what's the equivalent in historical representation i think that what you get that what we would call a reality effect in history uh is produced by taking uh what we would call um concrete entities and putting them within a frame that is recognizably found in as patterns of coherence in literary or poetic materials so and and what the uh when you say you feel like you're in the 17th century but of course the question is how would you know you know that this was what the 17th century it's like saying you know someone who's dead and he looks like he's sleeping right um how would you know that he's not sleeping he's dead you're feeling uh but when you say this is what it felt like to be in the 17th century uh you're taking it sort of on the word of the expert who studies the 17th century and knows presumably but it felt like to be in the 17th century but you're also what is being addressed are certain fantasies i mean i think having to do with feelings of nostalgia of the temporal distance exotic the exoticizing effect one of the things that history always does is play upon our desire to to familiarize the unfamiliar and it does it always by showing you how different the 17th century was than how like our own time it was but also ultimately how unalterably different it was and that effect that effect is what we would mean i think by the feeling that we could say oh yes that's what the 17th century felt like even though it makes no sense at all was uh i was commenting on the um i was commenting on the confusion that one often hears in discussions of the historical imagination and especially when it comes to representations of the past and how they relate to contemporary culture and so on but i think what you're saying is that there are certain fantasies or desires that we have about the past that are played upon by historians and other writers who deal with history and that these fantasies can be used to create a sense of familiarity even though the period being described may be very different from our own time ### Instruction: Convert the following unformatted text into well-structured sentences. 
### Unformatted Text: distinction between the factual discourse the fictional discourse in which they will say well history is characterized by the recounting of facts that actually happened and um i was remarking that at the outset of scott's uh novel the heart of midlothian scott uses that expression facts or puts it in the mouth of one of the training characters facts that actually happen and the locution real fact concrete fact and so forth is actually i think intends to talk about not facts which are after all verbal uh constructions predications and and and belongs to would say to the order of words not for the order of things um except as far as their linguistic things uh that uh the the event is what happened facts don't happen facts are made they're constructed uh as predications as linguistic entities events in one sense are not constructed they happen we can say that they happen and but the relationship between the fact and the event is that the fact is a statement about the event so it's improv it suggests confusion here so i it turns out however that one of the reasons this slippage occurs i think in discussions about the distinction between factual and fictional discourse i think the reason this confusion occurs is that we don't have a theory of the event i mean science has no interest in the individual event it's only events as belonging to a class of phenomena any given event would be and replicable that events under laboratory procedures so the historical event by definition is individual individualized or particular there's no such thing as a universal historically that makes no sense to say that you can say that there's a universal event in science like entropy it's an ongoing event that'll go on forever until we have the entropic condition perfectly realized so um that we won't be telling that story but when it comes to trying to theorize how historical events differ from naturally it's very difficult to do i mean what are the attributes of the specifically that it's hard to say and i think the reason that history is characterized by the recounting of facts that actually happened is because historians have a particular interest in individual events and they want to know how these events fit into larger patterns and trends so they're interested in what happened not just in general but in this specific case or in this specific moment and i think that that's why the distinction between factual and fictional discourse is actually quite important because it helps us understand how we construct our narratives about the past and how we use language to do so ### Instruction: Convert the following unformatted text into well-structured sentences. 
### Unformatted Text: lends itself to narrative representation is precisely because we have this enigma of the of the event which unlike the natural event is not reproducible in the present under laboratory conditions and is not directly perceivable it is known only by evidence or by its effects and therefore it's it appears to be the kind of happening the historic movement and surprises located in the past and what we mean by that is it's no longer something we can go and observe nor can we as a scientific events simulate adequately uh historically than some of the laboratory conditions so this leads to being construal the only way the event historical event can be construed isn't it as an enigma as an enigma and a mystery and it's the mystery of individuality it's an individualization uh the mystery of individualization that's what schopenhauer said was a great metaphysical problem but it's all cause of all suffering but many of them to theorize the individual event historically then as in the past and therefore not perceivable as being only one-of-a-kind and not repeatable and at the same time an object of knowledge and possible knowledge gets you into this very strange relationship that creates the historian's problematic that he or she solves by interrogating this event from as many different aspects as possible or perspectives as possible and then reconstructing it under the odor of some kind of pattern of coherence of a narrative kind of patterns codes we may say that are most fully realized in their perfect most perfect form and literary history let's shift you mentioned immediately in my mind very simple to me the 20th century has too many bodies in the world too many bodies um you know more people are living now that have lived in the whole history of the human race that's one thing overpopulation starvation scarcity two technology what technology does to the for the body um i think it's not only a quantitative difference in our capacities to kill and name and mutilate but uh qualitative death as johannes fabian says in his book time and space of colonialism is different than the kind of death that we experience in the west and so there's this kind of globalization of violence and it's not just a question of more bodies but also a question of different kinds of bodies being killed in different ways and different times and different places and i think that's what makes the 20th century so difficult to understand is that we have these massive changes in technology and population and globalization and then we have this kind of qualitative difference in how people are dying and it's not just a question of more bodies but also a question of different kinds of bodies being killed in different ways and different times and different places ### Instruction: Convert the following unformatted text into well-structured sentences. 
### Unformatted Text: famous essay how others die a death is something that happens to other you people it's poked in your face in the 20th century with images of dead bodies dying bodies starving bodies mutilated bodies incinerated bodies as in the holocaust i saw some statistics yesterday uh the average the average number of males murdered in the united states is four to seventy four times greater than the number of male average number of males killed in the other country 74 times greater than the number of males let's say your chances are and as for black males in the united states murder is i think a reflection of cause and large part by the atmosphere created by the horrendous powers of destruction that modern technology provides the byproducts of that technological mechanism in the forms of poisons atmosphere the production and the kinds of disease of which cancer is one and probably caused by the conditions of modern and so forth plus the the very prospect of the destruction of the earth or life or human life i think that um i think that the vulnerability of the body raises those questions it leads pauco into construing the history of the body in terms of the history of different kinds of cares how do you care for the body right conceived under these idealist terms in ancient greece and rome and stoic notions of exercise and so forth um different ways of construing the body but also i think it has to do with the fact that uh in our time uh we recognize and this is part in part a result of feminist uh attention to gender uh study that uh one's body is a construction that so when people talk about the body and feminists say whose body what they're saying is that the body is a social construction i mean it may have a material base a physiological basis but the image of the body that we carry around with this which is the subject of so much anxiety you reflect on the vulnerabilities and the prospect of mutilation can occur that's an imago i mean that's a that's um that's construction um uh it doesn't matter what the person thinks about themselves or how they feel about themselves or how they imagine themselves to be but it's the image that other people have of them and so forth and so i think that the vulnerability of the body raises questions about who cares for the body right in terms of uh in terms of medical care and also in terms of cultural constructions of what it means to be a person with a certain kind of body or a certain kind of gender identity
