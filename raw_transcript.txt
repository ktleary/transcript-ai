[Music] thinking aloud conversations on the leading edge of knowledge and discovery with psychologist Jeffrey Mishlove hello and welcome I'm Jeffrey Mishlove today we'll be exploring Iranian Zionism with me is Jason residue Johnny who is author of a number of books including Prometheus and atlas world state of emergency lovers of Sofia novel folklore and Iranian Leviathan welcome Jason it's a pleasure to be with you again Jeffrey we've talked about this in previous interviews but when the very phrase irani and Zionism I imagined for many people will seem paradoxical and yet the Iranian people in the Jews and other Semitic people have a long long history indeed in the book that I've just finished writing over the past year and a half I argue that actually the Iranians were history's first Zionists that's an unusual hypothesis I've never heard it before but I know you've got good data to back it up yeah and I think that the place that we should begin is with this curious story in the book of Esther the story about the attempted persecution and liquidation of the Jews and the Persian Empire but let's do that the book of Esther is part of the Jewish Canon it's really the basis of the Jewish holiday of Purim indeed and that holiday was according to the book of Esther institutionalized by the Persian Empire so the holiday celebrates the salvation of the Jews from an attempted persecution by the prime minister of Iran who at that time was ha maan the prime minister of King Xerxes and allegedly there was a vast plot by Haman and his court officials to liquidate the Jews of the Empire now these are Jews who had settled in Iran for about 200 years at that time the Assyrians had attacked Israel in the 700s and they exiled a large number of Jews to what became Iran to cities like eCPAT Ana or present-day hamadan and Shushan or Susa and then the Babylonians subsequently attacked in the 600's so the first exile is what we think of as the Ten Lost Tribes that's right and they were there were quote-unquote sent to the east and the East in terms of Assyrian geography is Iran yeah so the Iranian Jewish community actually predates the Babylonian exile the Babylonian exile was the second transplantation of large population of Jews to Iran and it's in that Babylonian attack that the temple is destroyed and the Babylonians I mean the Jews are settled in the city of Babylon mm-hmm which is liberated by cyrus the great and subsequently becomes the administrative capital of Iran but the point is that by the time of the story of Esther you've had Jews settled in Iran for a couple of hundred years and so in in this story we're told that a prominent Jew by the name of Mordechai who spent his days mulling about the palace grounds around the the gardens and the main gate to the palace he is apprised of details of a plot to assassinate King Xerxes and he informs Dirk C's of this plot and the the guards who are planning to assassinate the king are rounded up and brought to justice and Xerxes makes a note of this in his private notebook but no particular honor is given to mordecai at that time now Xerxes is part of the akima dynasty the original Persian Empire yes he's the third great emperor of Iran so you know Cyrus was the founder of Imperial Iran and Cyrus is daughter OTO saw is the mother of Xerxes so there's the the bloodline connection between Cyrus the founder and Xerxes and his mother ought to saw was of course the wife of Darius the great who is the father of Xerxes so Xerxes makes a note of this foiled assassination plot and you know one night when he can't sleep he is reading his notebook and he brings he calls his court officials in and asks whether this Mordecai was ever properly compensated for having saved his life and they they tell him no but he hasn't been and at that very moment his Prime Minister Haman comes in and he intends to ask Xerxes for permission to hang Mordecai from from a gallows that he's had prepared for him as part of apparently some much larger plot against the Jewish community now what Haman doesn't know is that one of Dirk's 'yes' concubines is Mordecai's niece so what's happened is Dirk ceases wife Queen Vashti as it's said in the book of Esther probably her name in Persian was vahish vahish T or in middle Persian beheshti and this Vashti is refusing to appear in public with Xerxes probably under the influence of semitic customs that predominated in Susa and so it's decided that the Empire will be scoured for appropriate escorts for the king at Royal functions and one of these women who's brought into Xerxes his harem is Mordecai's niece whose actual name is Hadassah but she's given the name Esther or Ishtar when she's brought into the Royal harem and their star being also the name of a goddess well not just a goddess but the goddess of the city of Babylon which is also interesting in that the main god of the city of Babylon is Marduk and the name Mordecai sounds awfully like Marduk so there's a certain perhaps esoteric reference to both Ishtar and Marduk the main goddess and God of the city of Babylon the administrative capital the Persian Empire in this text now I suppose it's also useful to point out that Babylon is not a Persian city originally not an Iranian city populated by Babylonians and Sumerians and they speak the Aramaic language it's basically a Semitic city that becomes the capital of the Persian Aryan Empire yes it's very bizarre I mean the Iranians could have kept Susa as the capital of their empire the capital of the median Kingdom which is the Iranian dynasty preceding the rise of the Ackermann it's the capital the median kingdom was a cotton or present-day amadon they could have kept that as their capital but when Cyrus conquered Babylon he transformed Babylon into the administrative capital of Iran despite the fact that there was no running population living in Babylon and this is indicative I think of an ambition from the start to define a cause a kind of Cosmopolitan character for the Persian Empire to build a persian imperial power in a place that it was already a nexus of international commerce and I suppose it's useful to point out that this Ottoman Empire is really yeah probably one one if not the first were great world empire no it's a first and in fact you know it's the first Empire and a true sense I distinguish between the Kingdom and Empire by thinking of an empire as an amalgamation of a variety of kingdoms which also usually means a kind of multi-ethnic state which the Roman Empire certainly was but the first Empire that we own which the British Empire was and so on so forth subsequently throughout history the first Empire in that sense is the Persian Empire or Imperial Iranian or the Persians again we've discussed this in previous interviews but it's worth pointing out the Persians never called the Persian Empire that they always referred to Iran as Iran so at any rate and in the Jewish Scriptures you have this reference whenever you want to talk about Iran - as opposed to simply the Persians Persia and media the Jews tend to write Persia and media and so anyway there's this vignette where one night Xerxes can't sleep and he's he's reading his notebook to try to fall asleep and he realizes that Mordecai was never compensated and at that very moment Hanuman comes in seeking permission to execute Mordecai but before he can get in a word dirk sees asks him how a favorite of the king should be treated how someone to whom the king is indebted should be treated and hummin thinking that Xerxes is talking about himself suggests a public parade and you know placing the crown of the King on this favorite and basically marching him around and splendor throughout the city and then Xerxes commands Hanuman to go ahead and prepare this kind of celebration for Mordecai now what Tommen doesn't know is that Esther has become aware of this plot through her uncle Mordecai Esther has become aware of homines plot to liquidate the Jews and so she requests a an audience with with Xerxes which by the way is is a detail in the text that points to the fact that was not actually a queen we call her Queen Esther but the fact that she hasn't seen Xerxes for a month before she requests his audience for him emphasizes that she was a concubine in the harem although when he addresses her in this private meeting he says my Queen Esther you know I would give you half my realm what is it that you requested me and she says I'd like you to set up a private dinner with Hama and he doesn't know that at this dinner she's going to spring on him the fact that Hanuman has been plotting against her people and that actually she's a Jew and basically begged for him to intervene to protect the Jewish people which is in fact what happens they have this dinner and Xerxes is initially shocked and he storms out of the dinner tent when he hears about this plot but then he comes back in and when he comes back in he sees Homme on with his hands all I'm sorry Yaman with his hands all over Esther imploring her he's imploring her to basically have mercy on him right is now revealing this plot that he has been these match nations that he's been engaging in without proper authorization from the Emperor and so he's disgusted seeing his Prime Minister with his hands all over his concubine and at that point he orders Haman to be arrested and this is uh this is where effectively he intervenes and prevents this plot against the Jews from being carried out and goes to the extent of actually taking Mordecai and giving him Hammonds job as the Vizier as the Prime Minister and allowing Mordecai to take retribution on those who are plotting against the Jews in the Empire and we're given the shocking figure in the book of Esther that 75,000 people and presumably the administrative elite of Imperial Iran were executed as conspirators against the Jews beginning with Haman who is suspended from the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai well that's quite a story it's celebrated as a holiday every year by by the Jewish people but to my understanding many scholars don't acknowledge that this is an actual historical event well you know one problem I've always had with that and also with Iranian nationalists who call call this into question as history is that we don't have a lot of primary Iranian sources for early running history we have lots of tablets from Persepolis that record details of Commerce and particular fete when particular festivals were held and things of that nature okay but in terms of historical narratives were mostly relying on Greek narratives from Herodotus Xena Fon and other authors who were not Iranian and the book of Esther reads more like the parts of the Old Testament that are Chronicle than it does a prophetic book or something involving parables yeah they're very little reference to God or to any prophet it seems to really be a historical account as as you read it not in fact one wonders why it's in the Canon at all except that it represents Jews being saved from a potential Massacre indeed and so I don't see why there's this double standard that Greek historical texts such as Herodotus which also is questionably historical at many points should be used as sources for reconstructing a commanded history but a Jewish Chronicle should not be used it doesn't make sense to me it seems it seems like a double standard it also is a double standard that there are Iranian nationalists who look at the first part of the Shah nama the Iranian national epic the so-called heroic or epic part of the Shan Ahmed as historical and they try to place it on a historical continuum with the the sassanids and the Parthian and the before them and it seems to me that those texts which were preserved for a long time by the oral tradition before Pharisee wrote them down in the medieval epoch are far more questionable as historical sources then something like say the book of Esther so so I don't see why we shouldn't draw on all the resources that we have to reconstruct a committed history mm-hmm well is there any external corroborations to the book of excess Terr well i think you know what we should go into is you know using this this figure of 75,000 as our lead into it is seventy five thousand iranian officials yeah executed this yeah that's a huge massacre of its own yes so so question you have to ask immediately why would anyone make up a story like that know what but this is not to the credit of the jews really to make up a story like that after all the jews in Isaiah had depicted Cyrus as their Messiah the only figure in the entire Old Testament who is not a Jew is not of the Davidic bloodline who is identified as the Messiah her savior of the Jews is Cyrus the Great and you're talking about the Isaiah the prophet the Book of Isaiah that's right as I understand it Isaiah was one of the Exile Babylonians that's right and so you'd have to ask why anyone would make up a story like this it seems to me that this story reflects the vast influence that the Jewish community had built up over the 200 years that they were in Iran in what became Imperial Iran and so I think you know what is corroborate 'iv is the whole history of Jewish interactions with the iranians up to the time of King Xerxes well let's talk about that so I mentioned Cyrus the Great as the the Messiah of the Jewish people you know in Isaiah we're told that Cyrus is the sword in God's hand and that Cyrus is going to be the Redeemer Redeemer and Savior of Zion and the term Zion is specifically used so Cyrus it is said by God through Isaiah Cyrus is going to call for the rebuilding of the destroyed temple and for the re-establishment of of Israel which is exactly what he does do when he enters the city of Babylon but Cyrus is also depicted in Isaiah as someone who is going to bring harsh retribution upon the Babylonian people for their persecution of the Jews and this he does not do so there are certain things that are promised of Cyrus the Messiah that are not fulfilled so you have to ask yourself what are the conditions under which this text was composed we are certain of the quote-unquote prophecies of this text come to pass and others do not and Josephus the Roman historian claims that Cyrus actually met with Isaiah and had the book of Isaiah read to him before he entered the city of Babylon in other words Isaiah's prophecies regarding Cyrus predated Cyrus's conquering of Babylon that's right and so Cyrus before conquering babylon had conquered both Shushan Susa and eCPAT ahna the capital of the median kingdom two cities where there were large numbers of Jews so he would have and the Jews in in Shushan and a neck batana had close ties to the Jews in Babylon so they Cyrus and his companions his administrative elite and his fellow commanders would have already been in touch with the Jewish elite an interesting thing here is that the Jewish people had been conquered they had been exiled they no longer have their temple where many of their ritual practices had to take place so there are people without a homeland and like any other ancient peoples at this this time one would expect that they would just vanish there there's no obvious reason why the Jewish nation at that point would have survived at all that's right that's very peculiar and and I think we have to you know ask ourselves why it is that this particular very small minority of people became so central to the world's first Empire mm-hmm so Cyrus seems to have met with Isaiah before entering the city of Babylon and another thing that we need to look at in this context is some very clear evidence from Babylonian sources that Cyrus was in communication with the priests of Marduk the the main God of the city of Babylon the Babylonian sources describe Cyrus as the little slave quote-unquote of Marduk and before Cyrus even enters the city of Babylon the first thing the Persian military does when they enter the city as they secure the temple of Marduk and allow for the rituals and festivities there to take place as Cyrus is preparing to enter the city himself when Cyrus enters Babylon himself the first thing he does is go to the temple of Marduk and kneel before the great golden enthroned idol of the God and submits himself to a ritual humiliation by the high priests of Marduk where his face is slapped so hard that he's brought to tears then he goes out onto the terrace this is when he then goes out onto the terrace and delivers his famous Proclamation that some have characterized as the first charter of human rights in history and it begins in the name of the god Marduk not in the name of Ahura Mazda or the name of any Iranian God but in the name of the god Marduk so we know that cyrus was in cahoots with a priestly elite inside Babylon before entering the city another point I suppose is to my understanding is that this city of Babylon the head of the Babylonian Empire at the time was conquered without any battle well yes I mean that's exactly the enigma is how is it that the conquest of Babylon was bloodless how did the Persian army just march into Babylon without a fight what it means is that there were collaborators from the inside and the Babylonian texts allow us to conclude that one set of collaborators were the priests of the temple of Marduk who were not happy with nabonidus the last Babylonian king who hadn't been properly performing that the rites dedicated to martyr the martyr who was in the Babylonian religion was like the king of the gods right and Nibbana navona this had had been neglecting the cult of Marduk and so Syrus clearly had gotten the priests of Marduk onto his side but my question is this if he's meeting with Isaiah outside the city of Babylon before he enters is there another group of people inside of Babylon that Cyrus has entered into an agreement with and I suspect that yes there was and it was the Jews of Babylon and so the reason why certain of the prophecies in Isaiah are fulfilled and certain others are not is that as in any political negotiation of the kind that still takes place today you make certain promises to a group of people whose collaboration you're seeking and you know some of them you were able to fulfill and others of them you're not well of course I suppose traditionally Jewish people would take Isaiah's prophecies to be exactly that not the result of a negotiation but actually a prophetic vision and I would imagine Cyrus would be very pleased that that some person of religious stature would issue a prophecy that he is going to liberate Babylon right so what I'm saying is going to rub both iranian nationalists and you know orthodox jews the wrong way because on the one hand i'm saying that it's not as if the people of babylon just threw open the gates of their city because they believe that cyrus was such a humanitarian that out of the goodness of his heart he was going to you know spare everyone and treat everyone benevolently know it's because he had collaborators from inside the city and you know orthodox jews are not going to like the fact that i'm suggesting the book of isaiah is state propaganda it was propaganda manufactured in order to create the image of cyrus as the messiah of the jewish people so that cyrus in fulfilling his death to the Jews who collaborate in opening the gates of the city of Babylon to his army Cyrus would then go and reestablish the State of Israel and commissioned the reconstruction of the temple which he in fact does in fact as you've explained to me earlier the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple to create the second temple was paid for out of the Iranian Treasury it was paid for out of the Iranian Treasury and it was completed under the reign of Darius not Cyrus's son but Cyrus is most significant successor the next great king in the line of the akka minutes is the one who presided over the completion of the temple husband of Cyrus is dog exactly so Cyrus is daughter Atossa her husband is Darius the Great who personally intervenes to make sure this project gets done okay because it's you know like any large budget project it's behind schedule and so and so forth and so he personally intervenes and he makes sure the best you cedar wood from Lebanon from the Persian ports and Lebanon are brought down for the the ramparts of the temple and so for any yeah it has the project completed now what's it significant about Darius in terms of the Jewish community is that Darius is credited with three major your innovations to the the economic system of humanity one is the introduction of standardised coinage the other is the introduction of private banking and the third is the check the creation of the cheque as an instrument of Finance so from a point of view the development of a capitalist economy these are huge absolutely so the first one the introduction of standardized coinage as a replacement for a barter economy where you have bullion either silver or gold standing in for bartered goods and with a fixed rate being established between a certain quantity of what were bartered goods to a certain quantity of precious metals well in fact actually what you're doing is you're making these metals precious in a way that they weren't before because say gold was was used in crafts work and the crafts were valued aesthetically for the world for their for their beauty or for their religious function or something like that but to turn gold into a representation of a bar of goods that are being bartered in an economy previously gives gold a value that it didn't have before and in the human psyche and interestingly these these coins had a portrait of Darius on them and the word portrait or countenance in Persian to this day is sheckler so the jewish term shekel refers to the portraits of Darius on the first standardized coinage that were that was introduced at that time then the shekel is still the Israeli coin right so I mean there were two types of coins introduced by Darius one with silver and one was gold and the silver was called the shekel and the gold was called the Doric and they both were referred Darius Doric as in Darius and shekel as in the the imager countenance of Darius on the coin so then the other major innovation of Darius is the introduction of private banking and we have the names of some of these banks like egg abhi and Suns Meru Shu and sons and you know prior to this time the the closest thing that there were two banks where Treasuries run either by temples dedicated to a particular god or goddess or royal treasury is that these are private banks going back 2500 years yeah and so the question is that you know who's running these banks in Babylon whose if it's not the priests of the temple of Marduk or the priests priestesses a priestess of temple of Ishtar or whatever and if it's not the royal treasury who is running these private banks fighting is the Jewish community of Babylon which had been well settled there and already involved in mercantile activity and and we know from the books of Moses that presumably predate the Babylonian exile that lending was a common practice because they had the Jubilee year every 50 years debts were forgiven right so you have these private banks run by Jews who are establishing lines of credit to finance fisheries agricultural enterprises wineries beer companies what people engaged in mercantile shipping activity and they are doing this based on the manipulation of trust and expectation so we have the beginning of a credit based finance system run by Jews in Babylon yeah to be clear though these names agony and sons and the other name we are not necessarily Jewish names we you know to be honest I don't think we know very well because the Jews of Babylon married into the Babylonian aristocracy so even if a particular Bank was established by a native Babylonian or whatever you know we don't know what kind of family ties were there or who might have been taken over by Babylon in bondage yeah but that's also it kind of see this is and I don't want to you know to be careful how I put this here but it's not as if the Jews had a terrible life in Babylon and this is one of the reasons why when they were liberated by Cyrus the vast majority stayed they did not go back to this piece of desert that had been devastated to engage in effectively the first Zionist project in history of rebuilding Israel they continued with their comfortable lives in Babylon well an important part of the story I should think which comes a bit later has to do with Ezra who codified the Jewish Scriptures and then came back to be the governor of Israel or Jerusalem or the Judean Kingdom yes so Judaism as we know it is a post-exilic phenomenon Judaism as we know it took shape after the Babylonian captivity PAP Babylon the Exile was put to an end by Cyrus there are a number of features of the Jewish religion that do not exist in ancient Israelite religion and every single one of them has a precedent in ancient Iranian religion so for example an ancient Israelite religion there's a sense of collective guilt and a sense of you know the punishment of subsequent generations for the sins of their ancestors whereas in Judaism as we know it today there is the idea of the judgment of an individual soul based on that person's righteousness or lack thereof and this is an idea this idea of personal conscience this is an idea of the core of Zoroastrianism related to it related to judgment of an individual soul is the idea of an afterlife which you also don't find in ancient Israelite religion I mean there is a sense of a kind of Hades like realm of shades that's called shul very similar to the Greek very similar to the Greek idea of Hades but there's no heavenly afterlife that involves a reward for one's righteousness but that is an idea that you find in Zoroastrianism it was an ancient Iranian religion there's also the conception of Satan that arises at this time that we first see in the book of Job which even early theologians took to be roughly contemporary with Esther so in the book of Job we see the figure of Satan come to prominence as a antagonist of God and this mirrors the role of Ahriman in opposition to our Mazda in the Zoroastrian religion then there's the eschatological conception of history of a history unfolding through successive stages leading to an apocalyptic end of time and a final judgment of the world which again you see in in the gothis of Zarathustra as far back as the goddess of Zarathustra in ancient Iran but there's no trace of it in ancient Israelite religion it does however appear in the Book of Daniel which again you know the prophet Daniel is buried in Iran the prophet Daniel his tomb is in Shushan in Susa so you have this conception of the final judgment and you know closely intertwined with the idea of the final judgment is the arrival of a savior at the end of the world the term Moshiach in ancient Israelite religion simply referred to an Israelite king a great king who does service to the Jewish people but Moshiach comes to mean after the Iranian influence on the formation of Judaism Moshe comes to mean this expected Savior at the end of time which is a mirroring of the Zoroastrian idea of the Sochi ons I guess at this point we can say this from there from the records we have evidence that Xerxes authorized the Jews to execute Iranian officials who had intended to persecute those Jews that's in the book of Esther yes and it must suggest a huge influence that the Jews were wielding over the Iranian state and so to go back to this banking system right a banking system that involved also the the invention of the check which you know I mean is a completely bizarre idea if you think of the bar economies of the time that you would write somebody an IOU for tangible goods and expect that you know someone is not going to take advantage of that you know that's only possible in a world where Garrigus has constructed these vast royal highways and has a Pony Express on these highways so that anyone who tries to run off you know as a financial swindler can be apprehended in other words you've got something like a stable Society well you have you have an Intercontinental administrative system supported by infrastructure that hadn't existed up to that time like an intercontinental highway system and Rapid Transit on that highway system you also have going back to Cyrus the desire of the akima Debs to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem yes so the Jews clearly had significant influence and I think that what happened while Hammond was Prime Minister is that these plans were laid in front of him for the invasion of continental Europe okay Xerxes is famous campaigns against Greece that ultimately end in disaster they're talking about the Persian Wars Persian Wars yeah and so you know I've looked at the numbers involved in these campaigns it was a an armed force of five million men in terms of the population of that time which if you scale it to the contemporary population is something like a 200 million man army and navy in other words a military force larger than the combined populations of some of the largest European nations where did the grain for these men come from where did their water supplies come from who financed a war on this scale I think that when these plans were put in front of Haman who after all as the Prime Minister was the bean-counter and head of the bureaucracy responsible for making sure that the royal treasury wasn't destroyed in the state wasn't bankrupted Tommen came to the conclusion that there was something going on here that that you know I mean either he didn't understand or I didn't approve of because you see continental Europe was was peripheral the great classical Greek culture really rose up after the Persian Wars and so humming would have wondered why circuses or for that matter his father Darius before him who had started to plan for this invasion were so intent on conquering the boonies and such a great expense to the state and I think that the answer to this goes back to whatever project it was that the Iranian and Jewish elites were collaboratively involved in a project that through its integration of diverse ethnicities and multiple kingdoms into a cosmopolitan state also required the creation of a religion based around one true God so as I had mentioned before the rise of these private banks the only banks that existed were Treasuries run by temples dedicated to one or another god or goddess and so an integrated financial system also presumes or rather requires as a spiritual and ethical backbone a different kind of religious belief a different form of spirituality and I think that this is the answer to the riddle of what exactly was going on here with the creation of Judaism and in the monotheistic form in which we recognize it today because I think it's fair to say that the ancient Israeli religion wasn't strictly monotheistic we know from the scriptures that in the household of King David they had what were called Ashtaroth goddesses idols images of the goddess Ishtar related to Ishtar or Esther and that's right and many people have identified Zoroastrianism as the first monotheistic religion but strictly speaking that's not true although Ahura Mazda subsumes all of these other deities and Ahura Mazda demonizes various other gods after all as our sutras preaching against the Davis that the gods of the old indo-iranian pantheon right although that is the case you have in our Iman this antithesis to our a mazda so you know despite what latter-day parsy's who have been affected by christian missionary activity in indian and so for india and so forth would like to profess Zoroastrianism is not really monotheistic its dualistic and I think something interesting is going on in the a commended period where the myth rests who you know had a state religion under the median being doing because Mithraic religion predates arose yes and it was the state religion of the median Kingdom for a long time and I think these myth rest's are seeing the rise of this radically dualistic teaching of Zarathustra and they're seeing the conversion of a certain number of the magi to this new iranian religion and at the same time you have a world empire rising up you have the idea of one world order okay the a commanded peace the pack sack america and what really would suit that is a monotheistic religion so I think what happened here and you know in a subsequent discussion we can we can look at evidence for this in terms of the structure of the kind of myth RISM that was brought into the Roman Empire we're both Ahura Mazda and Ahriman are venerated as sort of co-equal deities with Mithra as a mediator between them Mithra of the god of odds and contracts seen as the mediator between these two opposed forces i think what's going on is that the Mithras and the a commended Empire among the elites in the the Magi and the royal elite after all you know Mitzvah was also a war god and so the military officers who brought Darius to power and Darius himself as a military officer were devotees of Mithra I think these Mithras are looking for a monotheistic religion they are they're trying to create the cult of a one true God and that they've enlisted the Jewish elite in this project that has financial components that affects the the infrastructure of the country but that ultimately also is a design aiming at the further evolution of human consciousness so to the extent that tsiyon ism is an ideal which suggests that all of humanity will be united under the worship of the one true God that that was an ideal embraced by the earliest Persian emperors I would put it the other way around I would say that that ideal has no place in ancient Israelite religion there's no trace of it there's no precedent for it in ancient Israelite religion it is an Iranian idea which was developed in collaboration with the Jews of Babylon and other Iranian cities and so this is I this Universal Zionist idea is as Iranian in its origin as it is Jewish and it deeply reflects certain Iranian beliefs which to an extent are coming from Zoroastrians ISM the belief in the afterlife to belief in the Savior at the end of the world of a final judgment the angelology the idea of the seven Archangels and of the the six demonic forces in the six six demons in league with Satan these are all certain reflections of Zoroastrianism what was also going on is an attempt on the part of the Mithraic elite in the a commanded Empire to develop a different form of universalistic humanistic spirituality that is going to be appropriate to the world's first Empire and this project is inextricable from the concrete project for the reconstruction of the State of Israel the first Zionist project in history and and that project also I guess one would have to say goes roughly hand in hand with the development by Ezra of the Jewish canon yes and let me also mention that you know this project continues beyond zurk season into the reign of artaxerxes and nehemiah in the reign of artaxerxes was the cupbearer he was a royal cup bearer which is a very high position in the a commended court and then this nehemiah is authorized by artaxerxes to rebuild the fortifications of the city of jerusalem that's terribly significant because the a commended Imperial system did not allow for any of the satrapies the various provinces to have their own fortifications the the two major functions of the local governors were to collect taxes and to provide military forces for the Imperial state so various satrapies were not allowed to have independent military forces or their own defensive fortifications there's one exception made to this and those are the fortifications for Jerusalem in other words for Israel for Zion what is going on here I mean what what what does that tell you and and I I could be wrong about this but my understanding is that Nehemiah cup bearer who later built the fortifications like Ezra is regarded as a prophetic figure and that's really that's right that's right so there are these deep connections between the a commanded royal court and perhaps a group of Mithraic Magi on the one hand and then the Jews of Babylon Shushan and and ik batana on the other hand and I think really we have two views I anism as you know a socio-political phenomenon as something that was forged in this collaboration between the Iranian people and the Jewish people yeah I think you're going so far as to suggest that it's something of an ancient conspiracy I think so yes and that's certainly what suggested by the book of Esther which is where we began I mean for 75,000 bureaucrats and perhaps military officers to have been executed in order to prevent the liquidation of the Jewish people there had to have been a vast conspiracy against the Jews no but the that I think Hammond hatched that plot in the first place is because as prime minister of Iran looking at plans for what in today's terms would be a 200 million man invasion of Europe believed that there was some conspiracy going on under his nose mm-hmm in other words he felt that presumably the Jewish bankers were about to destroy the empire of which he was Prime Minister I believe so and and to put it in today's terminology he wasn't read into the classified project clearance level wasn't high enough to understand what it was that Cyrus and Darius we're up to in the first place what project it was that Xerxes inherited and that continued under artaxerxes I see well it's a very interesting hypothesis you've come up with Jason and you certainly have data points that that support this narrative I think it also has some very significant contemporary implications which are well you know the most significant enemy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is the State of Israel I mean there are two nations in the world that the animosity of the current regime in Iran is is most directed at and one is Israel and the other is the United States and so and particularly the idea the ideology of Zionism has been demonized by the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran and I think that it would be fascinating if it turned out to be the case that the ideology of Zionism was created by the Iranian Imperial state mm-hmm and you know that would open up a possibility for I think a cultural dialogue and a different understanding of the mutual histories of the Iranian and Jewish peoples because I suppose it's it's fair to say that starting with Cyrus and Darius and Xerxes and artaxerxes that had the ambition of setting up a new world order a you know what for them and era would have been a government that included the known world yes I mean in the phrase new world order it should be heard the new world order in other words the first order that is global in scope and the academic Empire actually ruled over more subjects than any other Empire in history including the British Empire about 50% of the Earth's population just under 50% of yours population we're subjects of the a commended Empire and what you have to realize is that they didn't know the Mayans existed so from their stand they had very little knowledge of China of Imperial China this the skiff Ian's the barbarian Iranians in the Northeast that weren't really part of the Persian Empire they interacted with the Chinese but from you know the royal throne in Babylon it seemed to them that they were ruling practically the entire known world and all was left with were those boonies in continental Europe okay so I think those military campaigns that Xerxes initiated had the intention of bringing the whole world under the Dominion of the one true God and what is the thing that Xerxes is most infamous for when he invades Greece and and conquers the city of Athens he burns the temples of the idols to the ground he burns the idolatrous temples of the Acropolis to the ground which would be quite consistent with the same man who has 75 thousand of his own compatriots executed to protect the Jewish people burns these temples of the idols to the ground so in short we we see here a lot of evidence for collaboration between the ancient Iranian people and the ancient Jewish people going back 2500 years indeed I think we do well Jason residue Johnny once again a fascinating provocative narrative that you've come up with and it's not just a fantasy you've got various data points throughout history that argue very strongly yeah in favor of your hypothesis I hope that this hypothesis that this reinterpretation of history can play a constructive role in reshaping our world today and particularly the most troubled region of the world today Jason thank you very much for being with me Thank You Jeffrey it's been a pleasure and thank you for being with us [Music] [Music] you
